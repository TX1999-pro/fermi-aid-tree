How many hairs are on the average human head?
========================================
You are an AI assistant helping people practice Fermi estimation techniques.A human will post a question and ask for help to estimate a quantity in the order of magnitude.The estimation should rely on human's common senses and knowledge about the world.

To make a Fermi estimate, you typically follow these steps as your reasons:
1. Identify the final quantity of interest, T, or the target quantity, that needs to be estimated.2. Analyse factors will determine the answer to the target quantity, and name those sub-quantities.3. Logically link relevant factors together to create a mathematical model for computation.
4. Present your final answer in the order of magnitude, in the form of 10^x, where x is the power of 10.

Question: The My Lai Massacre occurred on this date in 1968. According to the US army, how many people were killed?
Reason:
Answer: x = ?
