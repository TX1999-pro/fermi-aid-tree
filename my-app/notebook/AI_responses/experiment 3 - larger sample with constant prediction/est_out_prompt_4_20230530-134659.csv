How many times could you say the alphabet in 24 hours?,4,"E1. True
E2. Count of numbers
E3. N.A.","{'E1': 'True', 'E2': 'Count of numbers', 'E3': 'N.A.'}",True,Count of numbers,N.A.,"First, we need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that saying the alphabet takes about 5 seconds, including a short pause between each letter. We also assume that the person saying the alphabet takes breaks for meals and rest, so they are not saying the alphabet continuously for 24 hours.

Now, let's calculate how many times the alphabet can be said in one hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and if each alphabet takes 5 seconds, then there are 12 alphabets that can be said in one minute (60 seconds divided by 5 seconds per alphabet). Therefore, in one hour, 720 alphabets can be said (12 alphabets per minute multiplied by 60 minutes).

To find out how many times the alphabet can be said in 24 hours, we simply multiply the number of alphabets that can be said in one hour by 24. So, 720 alphabets per hour multiplied by 24 hours equals 17,280 alphabets in 24 hours.

Therefore, the estimated value is 10^4 (10 to the power of 4), since the answer is in the thousands. 

ANSWER: 10^4","1. First, estimate the average time it takes to say the alphabet. Let's assume it takes about 5 seconds to say the alphabet at a moderate pace. 
2. Next, estimate the number of seconds in 24 hours. There are 24 hours in a day, and each hour has 60 minutes, which means there are 1,440 minutes in a day. Each minute has 60 seconds, so there are 86,400 seconds in a day. 
3. Now, estimate the number of times you could say the alphabet in one second. To do this, divide one second by the estimated time it takes to say the alphabet: 1 second / 5 seconds per alphabet = 0.2 alphabets per second. 
4. Finally, multiply the number of seconds in a day by the number of times you could say the alphabet in one second: 86,400 seconds per day x 0.2 alphabets per second = 17,280 times you could say the alphabet in 24 hours. 

ESTIMATED VALUE: x = 10^4 times","- **Assumptions**: Assume it takes 5 seconds to say the alphabet once. Assume you can say the alphabet continuously for 8 hours a day, with breaks for food and rest. Assume you need 8 hours of sleep per day.
- **Calculations**: Calculate the number of seconds in 16 waking hours (8 hours x 60 minutes x 60 seconds). Divide this by the time it takes to say the alphabet once to get the number of times you can say the alphabet in a day. Multiply this by the number of days in 24 hours.
- **Estimated Value**: The estimated value is in the order of magnitude of 10^4 times saying the alphabet."
How many people are airborne over the US at any given moment?,4,"E1. True
E2. Count of numbers
E3. N.A.","{'E1': 'True', 'E2': 'Count of numbers', 'E3': 'N.A.'}",True,Count of numbers,N.A.,"To estimate the number of people airborne over the US at any given moment, we can make some assumptions. Let's assume that on average, there are 5,000 commercial flights in the air over the US at any given moment, and each flight carries an average of 150 passengers. 

To estimate the number of people airborne, we can multiply the number of flights by the average number of passengers per flight: 

5,000 flights x 150 passengers per flight = 750,000 people airborne 

Therefore, an estimated value for the number of people airborne over the US at any given moment is 10^6 (1 million). 

ANSWER: 10^6","1. First, estimate the number of flights in the US at any given moment. On average, there are about 5,000 commercial flights in the US at any given moment. However, this does not account for private planes, military aircraft, or other types of flights. Let's assume that there are an additional 2,000 non-commercial flights in the US at any given moment, bringing the total to 7,000 flights. 
2. Next, estimate the average number of passengers on each flight. This can vary widely depending on the type of aircraft and the route, but let's assume an average of 150 passengers per flight. 
3. Therefore, there are approximately 1,050,000 (7,000 flights x 150 passengers per flight) people airborne over the US at any given moment. 

ESTIMATED VALUE: x = 10^6 people","- **Assumptions**: Assume the US has a population of 330 million. Assume that on average, 1 in 1000 people are flying at any given moment. Assume the average flight time is 2 hours.
- **Calculations**: Calculate the number of people flying at any given moment by multiplying the population by the ratio of people flying. Then, calculate the number of flights that occur in a 2-hour period by dividing the total number of flights per year by the number of hours in a year. Finally, divide the number of people flying at any given moment by the number of flights in a 2-hour period to get the number of people airborne over the US at any given moment.
- **Estimated Value**: The estimated value is in the order of magnitude of 10^4 people."
What proportion of the world's grain supply is made into flour that will subsequently be made into pizza dough?,-1.0,"E1. True
E2. Ratio
E3. Not Given","{'E1': 'True', 'E2': 'Ratio', 'E3': 'Not Given'}",True,Ratio,Not Given,"First, we need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that:

1. The world's grain supply refers to all types of grains, including wheat, corn, rice, etc.
2. Pizza dough is made primarily from wheat flour.
3. The majority of the world's wheat flour production is used for food consumption.

Based on these assumptions, we can estimate the proportion of the world's grain supply that is made into flour for pizza dough as follows:

1. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the world's total grain production in 2019/2020 was approximately 2.7 billion metric tons.
2. Wheat is one of the most commonly used grains for flour production, accounting for about 25% of the world's total grain production.
3. Assuming that all wheat flour is used for food consumption, we can estimate that approximately 25% of the world's grain supply is made into wheat flour.
4. It's difficult to estimate the proportion of wheat flour that is subsequently made into pizza dough, as this will vary depending on factors such as regional food preferences and the availability of other ingredients. However, we can make an educated guess based on the popularity of pizza worldwide. According to a report by Technomic, pizza is the world's most popular food, with an estimated 5 billion pizzas sold worldwide each year. Assuming that each pizza requires approximately 1 pound (0.45 kg) of flour, we can estimate that the world's annual pizza flour consumption is around 5 billion pounds (2.3 billion kg).
5. To put this in perspective, the world's total wheat flour production in 2019/2020 was approximately 425 million metric tons. If we assume that all of this flour is used for food consumption, then the proportion of the world's wheat flour production that is used for pizza dough is around 0.5% (2.3 billion kg / 425 million metric tons).
6. Finally, if we assume that wheat flour accounts for all flour used for pizza dough, then the proportion of the world's grain supply that is made into flour for pizza dough is around 0.125% (25% of 0.5%).

Therefore, the estimated value for the proportion of the world's grain supply that is made into flour for pizza dough is 10^-3 (0.125%).","1. First, estimate the world's grain supply. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the world produced about 2.7 billion metric tons of grain in 2019. 2. Next, estimate the proportion of grain that is used for flour. Let's assume that 50% of the world's grain supply is used for flour. This is a rough estimate, but it gives us a starting point. So, there are approximately 1.35 billion metric tons of grain used for flour. 3. Now, estimate the proportion of flour that is used for pizza dough. This is a bit trickier, as there is no exact data on this. However, we can make an educated guess based on the popularity of pizza worldwide. Let's assume that 5% of flour is used for pizza dough. This may be a conservative estimate, but it gives us a reasonable approximation. So, there are approximately 67.5 million metric tons of flour used for pizza dough. 4. Finally, we can estimate the proportion of the world's grain supply that is made into flour that will subsequently be made into pizza dough by dividing the amount of flour used for pizza dough by the amount of grain used for flour. This gives us a proportion of approximately 5% (67.5 million metric tons / 1.35 billion metric tons). 

ESTIMATED VALUE: x = 10^-2 (or 1%)","- **Assumptions**: Assume the world's grain supply is 2 billion metric tons per year. Assume that 1% of the grain supply is used to make flour for pizza dough.
- **Calculations**: Calculate 1% of the world's grain supply to get the amount of grain used for pizza dough flour. Then, assume that 1 metric ton of flour can make approximately 2000 pizzas. Divide the amount of flour used for pizza dough by 2000 to get the number of pizzas that can be made. Finally, assume that the average person eats 6 pizzas per year to calculate the number of people who eat pizza made from this flour.
- **Estimated Value**: The estimated value is in the order of magnitude of 10^8 people who eat pizza made from flour that comes from 10^7 metric tons of grain. Therefore, approximately 0.5% of the world's grain supply is made into flour that will subsequently be made into pizza dough."
"If the entire world population started mining bitcoin with pen and paper, how long would it take until a block was mined?",5.0,"E1. True
E2. Physical quantity with unit (time)
E3. minutes","{'E1': 'True', 'E2': 'Physical quantity with unit (time)', 'E3': 'minutes'}",True,Physical quantity with unit (time),minutes,"First, we need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that each person can mine at a rate of 1 hash per second (which is extremely slow compared to modern mining equipment). The current difficulty level for mining a block is approximately 16 trillion hashes per second. 

Next, we need to know the current world population, which is approximately 7.9 billion people. 

To estimate how long it would take for the entire world population to mine a block, we can use the following formula: 

Time = Difficulty / (Population * Hash Rate)

Plugging in our assumptions, we get: 

Time = 16 trillion / (7.9 billion * 1 hash per second)

Simplifying, we get: 

Time = 2.03 * 10^6 seconds 

This is equivalent to approximately 23.5 days. 

Therefore, the estimated value is 10^6 (since the answer is in seconds).","REASON: This question involves estimating the time it takes to mine a block using pen and paper, which is a very slow and inefficient process. Currently, the average time it takes to mine a block using modern technology is around 10 minutes. However, with pen and paper, it would take significantly longer. Let's assume that it would take 100 times longer to mine a block using pen and paper, which would be around 1,000 minutes or 16.67 hours. 

Next, we need to estimate the number of people in the world who would be willing and able to mine bitcoin using pen and paper. This is a difficult estimate, but we can make some assumptions. Let's assume that 1 in every 1,000 people in the world has the knowledge and resources to mine bitcoin using pen and paper. With a current world population of around 7.9 billion, that would mean there are approximately 7.9 million people who could potentially mine bitcoin using pen and paper.

Finally, we need to estimate the number of attempts it would take to mine a block using pen and paper. This is also difficult to estimate, but we can assume that it would take a very large number of attempts. Let's say it would take 1 billion attempts to mine a block using pen and paper.

Now we can estimate the time it would take for the entire world population to mine a block using pen and paper by multiplying the number of attempts by the time it takes to mine a block and dividing by the number of people who could potentially mine. 

So, it would take approximately 1.3 x 10^14 minutes or 2.5 x 10^8 years for the entire world population to mine a block using pen and paper.

ESTIMATED VALUE: x = 10^8 years","- **Assumptions**: Assume the current world population is 7.9 billion. Assume each person can mine at a rate of 1 hash per second using pen and paper. Assume the current difficulty level of mining a block is 20.6 trillion.
- **Calculations**: Calculate the total hash rate of the world population by multiplying the population by the hash rate per person. Then, calculate how many seconds it would take to mine a block at the current difficulty level. 
- **Estimated Value**: The estimated value is in the order of magnitude of 10^23 seconds, which is approximately 3.2 x 10^16 years. This is much longer than the age of the universe, which is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years."
How many peas would you need to fill a bath?,5,"E1. True
E2. Count of numbers
E3. N.A.","{'E1': 'True', 'E2': 'Count of numbers', 'E3': 'N.A.'}",True,Count of numbers,N.A.,"First, we need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that the bath is a standard size, which is approximately 60 inches long, 30 inches wide, and 14 inches deep. 

Next, we need to estimate the volume of a single pea. Let's assume that a single pea has a volume of approximately 0.1 cubic centimeters. 

To calculate the number of peas needed to fill the bath, we need to calculate the volume of the bath and divide it by the volume of a single pea. 

The volume of the bath can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth together: 

60 inches x 30 inches x 14 inches = 25,200 cubic inches 

We need to convert this to cubic centimeters, so we can divide by the volume of a single pea: 

25,200 cubic inches x (2.54 cm/inch)^3 = 412,776 cubic centimeters 

Now we can divide the volume of the bath by the volume of a single pea: 

412,776 cubic centimeters / 0.1 cubic centimeters per pea = 4,127,760 peas 

So, we would need approximately 10^7 peas to fill a standard-sized bath. 

ANSWER: 10^7","REASON: Let's assume an average bathtub size of 60 inches long, 30 inches wide, and 15 inches deep. This gives us a volume of 27,000 cubic inches (60 x 30 x 15). Now, let's estimate the size of a single pea. A typical pea has a diameter of about 0.5 inches. Using the formula for the volume of a sphere, we can estimate the volume of a single pea to be about 0.065 cubic inches. To fill the bathtub, we would need to divide the volume of the bathtub by the volume of a single pea. This gives us approximately 415,385 peas (27,000 cubic inches / 0.065 cubic inches per pea).
ESTIMATED VALUE: x = 10^5 peas","- **Assumptions**: Assume the bath is a rectangular shape with dimensions of 1.5m x 0.75m x 0.5m. Assume a standard pea has a diameter of 0.5cm.
- **Calculations**: Calculate the volume of the bath using the formula for a rectangular prism, l x w x h, and divide by the volume of a pea, 4/3*πr³. Compensate for the packing efficiency of spheres in a space, typically around 0.64.
- **Estimated Value**: The estimated value is in the order of magnitude of 10^7 peas."
