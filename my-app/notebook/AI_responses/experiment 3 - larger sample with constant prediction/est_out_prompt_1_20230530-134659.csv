How many times could you say the alphabet in 24 hours?,4,"E1. True
E2. Count of numbers
E3. N.A.","{'E1': 'True', 'E2': 'Count of numbers', 'E3': 'N.A.'}",True,Count of numbers,N.A.,"First, we need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that saying the alphabet takes about 5 seconds, including a short pause between each letter. We also assume that the person saying the alphabet takes breaks for meals and rest, so they are not saying the alphabet continuously for 24 hours.

Now, let's calculate how many times the alphabet can be said in one hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and if each alphabet takes 5 seconds, then there are 12 alphabets that can be said in one minute (60 seconds divided by 5 seconds per alphabet). Therefore, in one hour, 720 alphabets can be said (12 alphabets per minute multiplied by 60 minutes).

To find out how many times the alphabet can be said in 24 hours, we simply multiply the number of alphabets that can be said in one hour by 24. So, 720 alphabets per hour multiplied by 24 hours equals 17,280 alphabets in 24 hours.

Therefore, the estimated value is 10^4 (10 to the power of 4), since the answer is in the thousands. 

ANSWER: 10^4"
How many people are airborne over the US at any given moment?,4,"E1. True
E2. Count of numbers
E3. N.A.","{'E1': 'True', 'E2': 'Count of numbers', 'E3': 'N.A.'}",True,Count of numbers,N.A.,"To estimate the number of people airborne over the US at any given moment, we can make some assumptions. Let's assume that on average, there are 5,000 commercial flights in the air over the US at any given moment, and each flight carries an average of 150 passengers. 

To estimate the number of people airborne, we can multiply the number of flights by the average number of passengers per flight: 

5,000 flights x 150 passengers per flight = 750,000 people airborne 

Therefore, an estimated value for the number of people airborne over the US at any given moment is 10^6 (1 million). 

ANSWER: 10^6"
What proportion of the world's grain supply is made into flour that will subsequently be made into pizza dough?,-1.0,"E1. True
E2. Ratio
E3. Not Given","{'E1': 'True', 'E2': 'Ratio', 'E3': 'Not Given'}",True,Ratio,Not Given,"First, we need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that:

1. The world's grain supply refers to all types of grains, including wheat, corn, rice, etc.
2. Pizza dough is made primarily from wheat flour.
3. The majority of the world's wheat flour production is used for food consumption.

Based on these assumptions, we can estimate the proportion of the world's grain supply that is made into flour for pizza dough as follows:

1. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the world's total grain production in 2019/2020 was approximately 2.7 billion metric tons.
2. Wheat is one of the most commonly used grains for flour production, accounting for about 25% of the world's total grain production.
3. Assuming that all wheat flour is used for food consumption, we can estimate that approximately 25% of the world's grain supply is made into wheat flour.
4. It's difficult to estimate the proportion of wheat flour that is subsequently made into pizza dough, as this will vary depending on factors such as regional food preferences and the availability of other ingredients. However, we can make an educated guess based on the popularity of pizza worldwide. According to a report by Technomic, pizza is the world's most popular food, with an estimated 5 billion pizzas sold worldwide each year. Assuming that each pizza requires approximately 1 pound (0.45 kg) of flour, we can estimate that the world's annual pizza flour consumption is around 5 billion pounds (2.3 billion kg).
5. To put this in perspective, the world's total wheat flour production in 2019/2020 was approximately 425 million metric tons. If we assume that all of this flour is used for food consumption, then the proportion of the world's wheat flour production that is used for pizza dough is around 0.5% (2.3 billion kg / 425 million metric tons).
6. Finally, if we assume that wheat flour accounts for all flour used for pizza dough, then the proportion of the world's grain supply that is made into flour for pizza dough is around 0.125% (25% of 0.5%).

Therefore, the estimated value for the proportion of the world's grain supply that is made into flour for pizza dough is 10^-3 (0.125%)."
"If the entire world population started mining bitcoin with pen and paper, how long would it take until a block was mined?",5.0,"E1. True
E2. Physical quantity with unit (time)
E3. minutes","{'E1': 'True', 'E2': 'Physical quantity with unit (time)', 'E3': 'minutes'}",True,Physical quantity with unit (time),minutes,"First, we need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that each person can mine at a rate of 1 hash per second (which is extremely slow compared to modern mining equipment). The current difficulty level for mining a block is approximately 16 trillion hashes per second. 

Next, we need to know the current world population, which is approximately 7.9 billion people. 

To estimate how long it would take for the entire world population to mine a block, we can use the following formula: 

Time = Difficulty / (Population * Hash Rate)

Plugging in our assumptions, we get: 

Time = 16 trillion / (7.9 billion * 1 hash per second)

Simplifying, we get: 

Time = 2.03 * 10^6 seconds 

This is equivalent to approximately 23.5 days. 

Therefore, the estimated value is 10^6 (since the answer is in seconds)."
How many peas would you need to fill a bath?,5,"E1. True
E2. Count of numbers
E3. N.A.","{'E1': 'True', 'E2': 'Count of numbers', 'E3': 'N.A.'}",True,Count of numbers,N.A.,"First, we need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that the bath is a standard size, which is approximately 60 inches long, 30 inches wide, and 14 inches deep. 

Next, we need to estimate the volume of a single pea. Let's assume that a single pea has a volume of approximately 0.1 cubic centimeters. 

To calculate the number of peas needed to fill the bath, we need to calculate the volume of the bath and divide it by the volume of a single pea. 

The volume of the bath can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth together: 

60 inches x 30 inches x 14 inches = 25,200 cubic inches 

We need to convert this to cubic centimeters, so we can divide by the volume of a single pea: 

25,200 cubic inches x (2.54 cm/inch)^3 = 412,776 cubic centimeters 

Now we can divide the volume of the bath by the volume of a single pea: 

412,776 cubic centimeters / 0.1 cubic centimeters per pea = 4,127,760 peas 

So, we would need approximately 10^7 peas to fill a standard-sized bath.
