    "Fermi estimation is a problem-solving technique that involves making rough estimates and approximations to arrive at a reasonable answer.\n",
    "Here's how you might approach it:\n",
    "QUESTION: How many piano tuners are there in Chicago? (answer with unit of 'piano tuners')\n",
    "REASON: 1. First, estimate the population of Chicago. The population of Chicago was about 2.7 million. \\\n",
    "2. Assume an average household size. In the U.S., this is typically around 2.5 people per household.\\ \n",
    "Therefore, there are approximately 1.08 million households in Chicago (2.7 million people / 2.5 people per household). \\\n",
    "3. Next, you would estimate the fraction of households with a piano. We can make a conservative estimate and say 1 in every 100 households owns a piano. \\\n",
    "So, there are about 10,800 pianos in Chicago (1.08 million households / 100). \\\n",
    "4. Now, estimate how often a piano needs to be tuned. Professional piano tuners usually recommend tuning a piano at least once or twice a year. \\\n",
    "Let's assume once a year for simplicity, so 10,800 piano tunings are required per year.\\\n",
    "5. Finally, estimate the number of tunings a single piano tuner can perform in a year. If a tuner works 5 days a week and 50 weeks a year, that's 250 workdays. \\\n",
    "Let's say a tuner can handle 2 tunings a day, which means one tuner can handle about 500 tunings in a year.\n",
    "Now you can estimate the number of piano tuners in Chicago by dividing the total number of annual tunings by the number of tunings per tuner. \\\n",
    "So, there are approximately 21.6 piano tuners (10,800 tunings / 500 tunings per tuner).\\\n",
    "ESTIMATED VALUE: x = 10^2 piano tuners\n",

    "- **Calculations**: Calculate the total number of pianos in New York City by multiplying the population by the ratio of piano owners. Then, calculate how many pianos a single tuner can tune in a year. Divide the total number of pianos by this to get the number of tuners.\n",

      "Step 1: Understand the basic structure of a neuron\n",
      "A neuron is a specialized cell that can transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. It consists of a cell body (soma), dendrites (branch-like structures that receive signals), and an axon (a long, thin structure that carries signals away from the cell body).\n",

      "Step 2: Identify the factors affecting signal transmission speed\n",

      "We know that the Earth's surface is about 70% water. The Earth's surface area is approximately 510 million square kilometers (5.1 x 10^8 km^2). So, the ocean's surface area is about 0.7 x 5.1 x 10^8 km^2 = 3.57 x 10^8 km^2.\n",

      "\n",
      "Step 3: Calculate the volume of the oceans\n",
      "To find the volume, we can multiply the surface area by the average depth: 3.57 x 10^8 km^2 x 4 x 10^3 m = 1.43 x 10^18 m^3 (converting km^2 to m^2 by multiplying by 10^6).\n",

      "Step 5: Calculate the mass of salt in the oceans\n",
      "Multiply the volume of the oceans by the salinity: 1.43 x 10^18 m^3 x 35 kg/m^3 = 5 x 10^19 kg of salt.\n",

      "A year on Earth is approximately 365.25 days.\n",

      "Step 4: Estimate the new length of a year\n",
      "Since the new orbital speed is 3.33 times faster than the current speed, the new length of a year would be 1/3.33 times the current length. So, we can divide 365.25 by 3.33 to get the new length of a year.\n",

      "\n",
      "Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for the pumpkin to fall\n",
      "We can use the formula for free fall: d = 0.5 * g * t^2, where d is the distance fallen, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and t is the time taken. Rearranging the formula, we get t = sqrt(2 * d / g).\n",

      "Since the seed is much lighter than the pumpkin, we can assume that air resistance will have a significant effect on its motion. To account for this, we can assume that the seed's horizontal speed will be reduced by half due to air resistance. So, the effective horizontal speed will be 24.5 / 2 ≈ 12.25 m/s.\n",

      "Step 6: Calculate the farthest distance a seed can land from the point of impact\n",
