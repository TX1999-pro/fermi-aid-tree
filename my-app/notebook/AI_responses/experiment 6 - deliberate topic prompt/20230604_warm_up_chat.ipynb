    "\n",
    "Fermi problems typically involve making reasonable assumptions about the problem, then performing simple calculations on those assumptions. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to apply this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the Problem Clearly: Start by identifying the problem you need to solve. Fermi problems often seem overwhelming at first glance due to the large numbers and broad scope involved. For example, \"How many piano tuners are there in New York City?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Break Down the Problem: Next, you'll want to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable questions whose answers can be reasonably estimated. For the piano tuner question, you might ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many people live in New York City?\n",
    "- How many households does that represent?\n",
    "- What fraction of households own a piano?\n",
    "- How often does a piano need to be tuned each year?\n",
    "- How many pianos can one tuner handle in a year?\n",
    "3. Make Estimates: Now, you'll need to make educated guesses to answer these smaller questions. You can often make a reasonable estimate based on known facts or basic assumptions about the world. For example, you might guess that one in every hundred households in New York City owns a piano, and that a piano needs to be tuned once a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Perform Calculations: Once you have your estimates, you'll need to perform the necessary calculations to solve the problem. Remember, the goal here isn't to get a perfectly accurate answer, but rather to arrive at a ballpark figure that's within the right order of magnitude. So, if your calculations require complex operations, it's usually okay to round numbers or simplify to make the math easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Review and Refine: Finally, you should always review your estimates and calculations to see if they make sense. If your answer seems unreasonable, you should go back and check your work, refine your estimates, or consider whether there are other aspects of the problem you haven't taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fermi estimation is an incredibly valuable tool for developing problem-solving skills and enhancing critical thinking. It encourages making reasonable assumptions, simplifying complex problems, and approximating – all crucial skills in a wide range of fields.'''\n",
    "\n",
    "round_2_recursion = '''This is a very structured approach. I am interested in the second step, which is breaking down a problem into sub-problems. This is a recursive step. Can you explain the concept of recursion?'''\n",
    "round_2_response = '''Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science, mathematics, and broader problem-solving that involves breaking a complex problem into smaller, manageable subproblems. The solution to the original problem is then constructed from the solutions of these subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recursive process has two key components: a base case and a recursive case. The base case is a condition that terminates the recursion, providing a direct solution without self-referencing. In contrast, the recursive case involves the function calling itself with smaller instances of the problem, leading towards the base case with each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a recursive function for calculating factorials in programming would include a base case (if n equals 0, return 1) and a recursive case (return n multiplied by the factorial of n-1). This function continually calls itself, moving closer to the base case each time, until it can start returning values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Fermi estimation and similar problem-solving methods, recursion entails breaking the problem down into subproblems until they can be easily solved or estimated. This 'divide and conquer' approach helps navigate complex problems, with the solutions to subproblems combined to solve larger ones, eventually addressing the original problem.'''\n",

    "\n",
    "The original problem is: \"How many piano tuners are there in New York City?\" This is a difficult problem to answer directly due to the lack of readily available data, so we break it down into smaller problems. Here's how that might look:\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimate the population of New York City: This is a base problem we can solve with known data. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, the population of New York City was over 8 million people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimate the number of households in New York City: This is a smaller problem we can estimate with a reasonable assumption. For instance, we could assume an average of 2.5 people per household, which is roughly the average household size in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimate the proportion of households with a piano: This is another smaller problem. We might not have an exact answer, but we can make a reasonable guess. Maybe 1 in every 50 households has a piano.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimate the number of times a piano needs tuning per year: Yet another smaller problem. A piano might need to be tuned once or twice a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimate the number of pianos a tuner can service in a year: This is the final smaller problem. A piano tuner might be able to tune 2 pianos a day, working 5 days a week, for 50 weeks a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these smaller problems contributes to the solution of the larger problem.
