To calculate the diameter of the Andromeda Galaxy in parsecs, you can follow these steps:

1. Find the diameter of the Andromeda Galaxy in light-years. According to NASA, the diameter of the Andromeda Galaxy is approximately 220,000 light-years.

2. Convert the diameter from light-years to parsecs. One parsec is equivalent to 3.26 light-years. Therefore, to convert 220,000 light-years to parsecs, you can divide 220,000 by 3.26.

220,000 light-years / 3.26 = 67,484.66 parsecs

3. Round the answer to the nearest order of magnitude. Since the question specifies that the answer should be in the order of magnitude of 10^5, you can round the answer to the nearest 10,000 parsecs.

Therefore, the diameter of the Andromeda Galaxy in parsecs is approximately 67,500 parsecs.

To work out the diameter of the Andromeda Galaxy in parsecs, follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know the diameter of the Andromeda Galaxy in light-years. The Andromeda Galaxy is approximately 220,000 light-years in diameter.

2. Next, we need to convert light-years to parsecs. One parsec is equal to about 3.26 light-years. 

3. To convert the diameter from light-years to parsecs, divide the diameter in light-years by the conversion factor (3.26). 

   220,000 light-years / 3.26 light-years/parsec ≈ 67,485 parsecs

4. Now, let's express this value in the order of magnitude of 10^5. To do this, divide the value by 10^5:

   67,485 parsecs / 10^5 ≈ 0.67485

5. Finally, to express the diameter in the order of magnitude of 10^5, multiply the result from step 4 by 10^5:

   0.67485 * 10^5 ≈ 67,485 parsecs

So, the diameter of the Andromeda Galaxy is approximately 67,485 parsecs, which is in the order of magnitude of 10^5.

To find the approximate height of the 22nd tallest building in the world in feet, you can follow these steps:

1. Look up a list of the tallest buildings in the world.
2. Find the height of the 21st tallest building and the height of the 23rd tallest building.
3. Take the average of these two heights to get an estimate of the height of the 22nd tallest building.
4. Convert the estimate to feet.

Based on current data, the 21st tallest building in the world is the Ping An Finance Center in China, which is 1,965 feet tall. The 23rd tallest building is the Lotte World Tower in South Korea, which is 1,819 feet tall. Taking the average of these two heights gives an estimate of 1,892 feet for the 22nd tallest building.

Therefore, the approximate height of the 22nd tallest building in the world in feet is 10^(3.28), or about 1,892 feet.

To find the height of the 22nd tallest building in the world, follow these steps:

1. Search for a list of the tallest buildings in the world. You can use websites like Wikipedia, Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), or SkyscraperPage.

2. Look for the 22nd tallest building on the list. Note that the list may change over time as new buildings are constructed or existing ones are surpassed in height.

3. Find the height of the 22nd tallest building, usually listed in meters. If the height is not available in feet, you can convert it using the conversion factor 1 meter = 3.28084 feet.

4. Round the height to the nearest order of magnitude. This means finding the power of 10 that is closest to the height in feet. For example, if the height is 1,200 feet, the closest power of 10 is 10^3 (1,000).

Based on the current list of tallest buildings, the 22nd tallest building is around 1,400 feet tall. So, my estimate for the height of the 22nd tallest building in the world is 10^3.
