How many Americans are polled in political polls every year?,5,"E1. True
E2. Count of numbers
E3. N.A.","{'E1': 'True', 'E2': 'Count of numbers', 'E3': 'N.A.'}",True,Count of numbers,N.A.,"T = Number of Americans polled in political polls every year
Sub-quantities: 
- Total US population (P)
- Percentage of population polled (p)
- Number of political polls conducted per year (n)

Assumptions:
- Assume that the percentage of population polled is small enough that it does not significantly affect the total population estimate.
- Assume that each political poll surveys a different group of people, so there is no overlap in the number of people surveyed.

Mathematical model:
T = P * p * n

Estimation:
- Total US population is approximately 330 million (P = 3.3 x 10^8)
- Assume that 10% of the population is polled each year (p = 0.1)
- Assume that there are 100 political polls conducted each year (n = 100)

How many tiles are on a room's floor?,2,"E1. True
E2. Count of numbers
E3. N.A.","{'E1': 'True', 'E2': 'Count of numbers', 'E3': 'N.A.'}",True,Count of numbers,N.A.,"QUESTION: How many tiles are on a room's floor?

REASON:
1. T = Total number of tiles on the room's floor.
2. Factors that determine T:
   - Area of the room's floor
   - Size of each tile
   - Shape of the room
   - Pattern of tile placement
   - Wastage due to cutting tiles to fit edges and corners
3. Assuming the room is rectangular, we can calculate the area by multiplying the length and width of the room. We can estimate the size of each tile to be around 1 square foot (0.09 square meters). We can assume a simple pattern of tile placement without any intricate designs. We can also assume a wastage of around 10% due to cutting tiles to fit edges and corners.
4. Calculation: 
   - Let's assume the room is 10 feet by 12 feet, so the area is 120 square feet.
   - Assuming each tile is 1 square foot, we need 120 tiles to cover the entire floor.
   - Accounting for 10% wastage, we need an additional 12 tiles.
   - Therefore, the total number of tiles on the room's floor is approximately 132.

Sub-quantities:
- Distance between origin and listener (100 feet or 34.5 meters)
- Sound intensity at origin (measured in decibels or dB)
- Sound attenuation due to distance (measured in dB)
- Threshold of hearing (0 dB)
Assumptions:
- Assume no obstacles or barriers between origin and listener
- Assume no other ambient noise present
- Assume listener has normal hearing
Mathematical model:
- Sound intensity at origin - sound attenuation due to distance = threshold of hearing
- Convert distance from feet to meters: 100 feet = 30.48 meters
- Sound attenuation due to distance can be calculated using the inverse square law: 20log(30.48/1) = 54.6 dB
- Therefore, sound intensity at origin = threshold of hearing + sound attenuation due to distance = 0 dB + 54.6 dB = 54.6 dB
