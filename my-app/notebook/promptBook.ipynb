It is also influenced by the water requirements and water retention capabilities of different species.

By combining this information, we can calculate the total amount of water contained within living beings and compare it to the Earth's total water supply.

      "1. Find the population of Brighton, UK. According to the latest census data, the population of Brighton is around 290,000.\n",
      "\n",

      "290,000 x 25 = 7,250,000\n",

      "1. Estimate the population of Brighton: According to recent data, the population of Brighton is approximately 290,000 people.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Calculate the total number of ice cream buyers: Multiply the population and the percentage of residents who buy ice cream (290,000 * 0.5 = 145,000) and do the same for tourists (11,000,000 * 0.5 = 5,500,000).\n",
